**File Purpose**: Project vision, goals, and success criteria

# Purpose
- a simple app to help ambient music producers and other digital creatives come up with ideation prompts that guide/spark/channel the creative process
- allows a user to collaborate with the app (via LLM API call behind the scenes) in a simple way to evolve prompts until something the user find inspiring is arrived upon
- user can save prompts to favorites (just local for now)
- user can view and manage favorites
- generation screen shows current prompt in a large card, with colored buttons either side
- buttons trigger the LLM to riff off of the current prompt, but in ways that evolve the prompt in a given direction: wild, pure, earthy, classy, emotive, and complex
- look and feel is minimialist but with an understated wow factor; that is, sleek and classy with an earthy, forest-like toning
- inspired in part by the idea of Brian Eno's 'Oblique Strategies'; but this is a modern take

# Target Users
- myself for now, acting as a self-coach in ambient electronic music creation sessions, using this app to create prompts that perform that self-coaching

# Core Principles
- simple, sleek, minimalist, generative, classy, modern but non-techy feeling

# Success Criteria
- i am able to discover really great ideation prompts that go on to inspire creation sessions in which I produce work I'm proud of 

# Constraints
- deploy to vercel, but no logins/accounts for now -- prefs and saves are local to the device
- mobile-first approach, but able to handle big screen (typically would be a tall, narrow window beside a DAW)
