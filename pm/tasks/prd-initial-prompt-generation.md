# Feature-Specific PRD

**Feature Name**: Initial Prompt Generation
**Feature Description**: Create the core prompt generation UI with input form and display of generated prompts

## Purpose
This feature provides the foundation of the application by enabling users to generate creative prompts that will inspire their ambient music production or other creative work. It solves the problem of creative blocks by offering tailored, inspiring prompts that can guide the creative process.

## Objectives
1. Enable users to input initial concepts/ideas to generate creative prompts
2. Display generated prompts in a visually appealing card format
3. Provide a clean, minimalist interface that doesn't distract from the creative process
4. Ensure the UI works well on mobile devices and as a narrow window beside a DAW
5. Allow users to clear/reset the current prompt to start fresh

## User Stories
- As an ambient music producer, I want to input seed concepts to generate creative prompts so that I can overcome creative blocks and find new directions for my music.
- As a digital creator, I want to view generated prompts in a clean, focused interface so that I can concentrate on my creative work without distraction.
- As a user, I want to clear the current prompt and start fresh so that I can explore different creative directions.
- As a user, I want the application to remember my last prompt between sessions so that I can continue my creative exploration where I left off.
- As a user, I want to see the prompt displayed prominently so that I can easily read and absorb the creative suggestion.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must provide an initial input form when no current prompt exists
   - Form must include a text input field for seed concepts/ideas
   - Form must include a submit button to generate the initial prompt
   - Form may include example suggestions for inspiration

2. The system must display the current prompt in a card format
   - Card must be visually prominent and centrally positioned
   - Card must have sufficient padding and appropriate typography for readability
   - Card must use the design tokens specified in the design system

3. The system must provide a clear/reset button to remove the current prompt
   - Button must be visually accessible but not distracting
   - Button must trigger the initial input form to reappear

4. The system must store the current prompt in local storage
   - Current prompt must persist between page refreshes
   - Current prompt must be retrieved when the user returns to the application

5. The system must handle loading states during prompt generation
   - Loading indicator must be displayed during API calls
   - UI must prevent further interactions during loading

6. The system must handle error states if prompt generation fails
   - Error message must be displayed if the API call fails
   - System must allow the user to retry or start over

7. The system must implement responsive design
   - UI must adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - UI must work well as a narrow window beside a DAW

## Exclusions
- This feature will not include the prompt evolution functionality (directional buttons)
- This feature will not include the favorites management functionality
- This feature will not include the prompt editing functionality
- This feature will not include user accounts or cloud synchronization
- This feature will not include social sharing capabilities

## Design References
- **Card Component**: Use the `PromptCard` component as defined in the components guide
  - Background: `{color.surface.card}` (#ccc19e)
  - Border radius: `{radius.lg}` (24px)
  - Box shadow: `{elevation.2}` (0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15))
  - Padding: `{spacing.6}` (24px)
  - Max width: 380px

- **Typography**:
  - Prompt text: Font family `{typography.font-family.display}` ('EB Garamond',serif)
  - Prompt text: Font size `{typography.font-size.xl}` (24px)
  - Prompt text: Color `{color.text.primary}` (#1b2f1d)

- **Input Form**:
  - Text input field for seed concepts
  - Submit button
  - Optional example suggestions

- **Clear Button**:
  - Use the `ClearButton` component
  - Background: transparent
  - Color: `{color.accent.calm}` (#62827c)
  - Border radius: `{radius.pill}` (999px)
  - Icon: eraser

- **Layout**:
  - App background: `{color.surface.app}` (#132114)
  - Navigation bar: `{color.surface.nav}` (#1c1b0e)
  - Centered content with appropriate spacing

## Technical Considerations
- Implement using Next.js 15 and React 19 as specified in the tech stack
- Use the API endpoint `GET /api/initial-prompt` for generating the initial prompt
- Store the current prompt in local storage using the specified schema
- Implement proper loading and error states during API calls
- Ensure responsive design works across all specified breakpoints
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling according to the design tokens

## Success Metrics
- Users can successfully generate creative prompts from their input concepts
- The interface is clean, minimalist, and visually appealing
- The prompt card is prominently displayed and easy to read
- The application successfully stores and retrieves prompts from local storage
- The UI adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations
- The application loads and responds quickly, without noticeable lag
