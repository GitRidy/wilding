# 1. Project Overview

**What is it?**
- A Next.js-based web app for creative ideation
- Inspired by Brian Eno's 'Oblique Strategies' but with a modern, interactive approach
- Minimalist design with an understated wow factor - sleek and classy with earthy, forest-like toning

**Who is it for?**
- Ambient music producers and other digital creatives
- Initially focused on the creator's own creative process
- Anyone seeking inspiration or guidance during their creative sessions

**What does it do?**
- Generates ideation prompts that guide, spark, and channel the creative process
- Allows users to collaborate with the app (via LLM API) to evolve prompts until something inspiring is found
- Displays the current prompt in a large card with colored buttons that evolve the prompt in different directions (wild, pure, earthy, classy, emotive, complex)
- Enables users to save favorite prompts locally and manage their collection
