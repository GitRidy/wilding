**File Purpose****: Overview of starter kit structure and usage. To be deleted after kit is installed to new project.

# Project Purpose & Approach

A lightweight project template for guiding development of small Next.js web apps with LLM assistance. Typically for small projects that might be developed with Roo Code, deployed on Vercel, and serve 10s to 100s of users.

- Provides design development helper files, docs, PM helper files, and dev helper scripts.
- Does not provide folders created by Next.js


# Phase A - Setup

## Initialize Project
_Assuming Next.js 15, Typescript, Tailwind CSS_

1. Create new `project_root` folder
2. Open terminal in `project_root`
3. Scaffold Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --ts --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --use-pnpm --import-alias "@/*"
```

4. pnpm dev


## Copy Starter Kit

1. Copy kit files to project (via temp folder):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitRidy/nextjs15_starter_kit.git temp_kit
cp -r temp_kit/* .
cp temp_kit/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
rm -rf temp_kit
rm -rf .git
```

2. Merge scripts from `package.kit-extra.json` into `package.json`

## Git Setup

1. In VS Code terminal, initialize git and commit

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with starter kit"
```

2. Create new GitHub repo (GitRidy/repo_name)
3. Connect local repo to GitHub and push:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/GitRidy/repo_name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Save VS Code Workspace

1. Make .vscode folder
2. Save workspace there

## Phase B - Planning

See `plan.md`
